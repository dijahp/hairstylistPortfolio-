            <h2>About Lida</h2>
            <p>Originally from and currently working out of Atlanta, Georgia, Lida is a licensed hairstylist specializing in balayage and highlighting.</p>
            <p> From a young age she's been an artist in many different mediums ranging from pen and paper to jewelry making and more, with an especially strong eye for design.</p>
            <p>Initially planning to pursue a career in the graphic arts, she eventually discovered that her true passion lay in hairdressing, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
            <p>What sets Lida apart from her peers in the industry is her innate capability to transform clients, rather than just trying to cover them up.</p>
            <p>She firmly believes that all people are beautiful, and she simply enjoys enhancing their natural gifts.</p>
